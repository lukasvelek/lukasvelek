                            The framework I use in my newest projects

                        <p class="page-content-text">
                            The framework currently has no name and is not available for usage in other projects. The reason for that is that I still haven't been able to separate it from the projects.
                            However when I finish the separation, I'll link it here.
                            <br>

                        <p class="page-content-text">
                            The idea for creating my own framework began slightly after I joined the company where I am employed. Here we create web applications in PHP and we utilize Nette framework.
                            <br>
                            Ever since I started programming I never liked to use other people's code. Therefore most of my projects only utilized libraries like Bootstrap CSS or jQuery.
                            <br>
                            So, because I didn't want to learn Nette and its components, I decided to create my own framework that would follow the MVP.
                        </p>

                        <p class="page-content-text">
                            Every application that uses this framework has "index.php" that is the point of all the action. In this script an instance of Application class is created.
                            <hr>
                            <i>
                                Application class is the main class of the whole application. It calls the render engine that is responsible for further UI rendering.
                                It contains instances of necessary repositories or managers.
                                <br>
                                It also has definitions of important functions.
                            </i>
                            <hr>
                            This script is also responsible for displaying the content rendered by the Application class to the user.

                            UI
                        </p>

                        <p class="page-content-text">
                            UI is divided into modules that allows separation of administration from the general UI.
                            <br>
                            Each module is further divided into presenters.
                            <br>
                            Every presenter can further describe more UIs. E.g.: LoginPresenter can be responsible for the login screen UI as well as the <i>forgot password</i> UI.
                            <br>
                            Each UI has its own template that must exist. This template can utilize variables:
                            <br>
                            <code>
                                $PAGE_TITLE$
                            </code>
                            <br>
                            If no definition for the variable exists it is displayed in its raw form -> what you see.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            However templates can also define components:
                            <br>
                            <code>
                                $component COMPONENT_NAME$
                            </code>
                            <br>
                            Components must have a definition otherwise exception is displayed.
                        </p>

                        <p class="page-content-text">
                            There are 4 types of functions available to the user in the presenters.
                            <br>
                            They are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>action&lt;Action&gt;()</li>
                                <li>handle&lt;View/Action&gt;()</li>
                                <li>render&lt;View&gt;()</li>
                                <li>createComponent&lt;ComponentName&gt;()</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <b>action&lt;Action&gt;()</b> is called only in AJAX requests.
                            <br>
                            <b>handle&lt;View/Action&gt;()</b> is called before render&lt;View&gt;() and can handle form submit, user redirect, etc...
                            <br>
                            <b>render&lt;View&gt;()</b> is called after handle&lt;View/Action&gt;() and is intended for filling template variables.
                            <br>
                            <b>createComponent&lt;ComponentName&gt;()</b> is called only if the template contains a component. This method must return an instance of the IRenderable interface
                            that "tags" the implementing class as renderable and calls the class' <i>render()</i> function.
